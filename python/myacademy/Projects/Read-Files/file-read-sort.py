# Write a Python program that counts words in a .txt file
# It should give a report of words and the number of occurrences in descending order.
# I should also be able to exclude common words
# such as “the”, “of”, “to”, “a” etc. stored in a separate .txt file
# and pass it as a parameter to the Python program.
